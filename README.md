# Classification-Approach-of-Alzheimer-by-MRI-Imaging-and-Gene-Detection
The proposed system aims to detect and classify Alzheimers disease (AD) to improve patient's quality of life by providing early detection and timely treatment using a combination of speech-to-text techniques, machine learning, bioinformatics, and image processing. The goal is to accurately determine whether a user is an AD patient or not and to classify the severity stage, which includes Cognitive Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer Disease (AD). The system combines three approaches to achieve accurate labeling.
